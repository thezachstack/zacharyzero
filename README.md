## Hi there 👋

**zacharyzero/zacharyzero** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some foundational Python for network engineering projects that are revolve around the use of Cisco and Juniper network devices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Bash scripting, as well as studying Artificial Intelligence Foundations at University of Maryland Global Campus. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me become more proficient in Python, especially projects for network automation. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding projects that are suitable for my skill level. I'm also looking for a more senior Python coder to help me fine tune my personal projects. 
- 💬 Ask me about government contracting work. I am the contracting site lead for the U.S. Navy's cybersecurity location for the West Coast.
