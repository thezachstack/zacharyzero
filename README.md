## Hi there 👋

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me become more proficient in Python and Bash scripting, especially projects for network automation. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding projects to progress my skill level. I'm also looking for a more senior coders who have experience in network automation to help me fine tune my projects. 
- 💬 Ask me about government contracting work. I have been in the field for 15+ years.
